,,,,,,,,
 in 50 years, people are going to look back — and not even that long — your children or grandchildren will look back and say this was the moment when America won the future.  Won the future. ,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
 I’ve said it a thousand times — I mean it from the bottom of my heart: There is not a single thing America can’t do when we do it together.  Never.  We’re the only country in the world that has — when we set our mind to something, that has never ever, ever, ever failed. ,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
 the poor to have a shot at the middle class, and the middle class to be able to breathe more easily.  That’s what this is about.  But this time, bring everybody along — everybody. ,,,,,,
